# SmashBall
This is a personal project involving a ball with an internal RGB led. When you shake it, it wakes up from deep-sleep and flashes a sequence of lights, then returns to deep sleep. Mostly an excuse to learn about how to enable deep sleep with the AtTiny85 and get back into bit registry coding.
